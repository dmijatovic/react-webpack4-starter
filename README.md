# React webpack 4 (simple) starter template

This is simple webpack 4 starter with scss enabled. At the moment of creating this starter create-react-app cli uses webpack v3. I created starter tailored toward my needs.

I will probably use create-react-app cli when it starts using webpack v4. For now this is simple starter just to learn webpack 4 and integration of react.js in it.

I started completely from scratch taking all latest versions avaliable at the time (2018-07-07).

## NPM installation scripts

Just run `npm install` and all libs mentioned here below should be installed.

```bash
  # 1. install react dom
  npm i -s react react-dom
  # 2. install webpack modules
  npm i -D webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server webpack-bundle-analyzer
  # 3a. install babel loaders - basics v7
  npm i -D babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react
  # 3b. install babel loaders - used features v7
  npm i -D @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties @babel/plugin-proposal-decorators
  # 4a. install scss/css loaders - basics
  npm i -D node-sass sass-loader css-loader mini-css-extract-plugin
  # 4b. install post-css loaders
  npm i -D optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin postcss-loader postcss postcss-preset-env autoprefixer cssnano
  # 5. install other webpack util plugins
  npm i -D html-webpack-plugin url-loader copy-webpack-plugin uglifyjs-webpack-plugin clean-webpack-plugin

```

## NPM scripts

- `npm start:` start webpack in watch mode passing dev environment (--env=dev).
- `npm run dev:` start webpack-dev-server using dev environment (--env=dev)
- `npm run build:dev:` Build development version.
- `npm run build:` Build production version to dist folder. Note that previous build will be removed first.

## Webpack config scripts

Webpack configuration is stored in webpack folder. Initially 2 separate def files are created. Based on --env parameter passed on init one of the configuration files is loaded as webpack config module (see webpack.config.js)

- `dev:` this is development environment setup (webpack/dev.js)
- `prod:` this is production build setup (webpack/prod.js).

**Note! Configuration is not 'shared' between files. When updating, please adjust/update the properties in both files where needed.**

BTW: I have chosen here simpler approach with some code duplication above more complex setup (without code duplication).

## Folder Structure

- **`assets`**: all asset files used like original logo and other images etc. Excel template for creating json files is also here.
- **`dist`**: builds are here
- **`src`**: holds all react code to be processed by webpack. **All js/css files need to be inside `src` folder**, otherwise Webpack wonâ€™t see them.
    - **component**: holds shared/general react components used by multiple pages
    - **layout**: holds react components which define global page layout
    - **page**: holds react components that represent pages (uniek in design/composition)
    - **router**: holds defined routes, react router setup and main router component. This router component is then integrated into main/global layout component.
    - **store**: holds all redux files used to setup redux store including implementation of custom middleware functions.
    - **styles**: holds css (js possible too) files related to defining global styles, overrides, css variables etc.
    - **utils**: holds uitility function
- **static**: static files that will be included in the build
- **webpack**: webpack configuration file from react-scipts

## Git branches

Master will have same content as base setup.

- master: same as base.
- base: basic rect-dom setup with support for scss, postcss, fonts and images.
- router: setup extended with react-router
- redux: setup extended with redux
- material: setup extended with react-material lib
